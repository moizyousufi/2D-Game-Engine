# 2D Game Engine

### Installation

To run this game engine, you must install the SDL-related libraries.

For Debian (MathLAN included) / Ubuntu Linux Versions, run the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev
```
From there, download the game engine files. If it is in a zip file, then extract that into its own folder.

Using the `cd` command, navigate to the folder containing `game.c` and `makefile` and run:

```
make
```

Keep in mind, the game engine, in its current state, would require assets from directories (as listed in the code when loading in textures). Resultingly, this may entail that you provide your own textures. I am using Nintendo-related textures for testing, and that would result in likely Copyright-related issues if I provided them / uploaded to GitHub for usage or put them out for production in any scenario.

Once the program has compiled, run:

```
./game
```

### Running the Base Game 

The controls are simple.

Type 'w' to move the player sprite up.
Type 's' to move the player sprite down.
Type 'a' to move the player sprite left.
Type 'd' to move the player sprite right.

Type 'ENTER' to switch menus, and type 'w' or 's' to navigate menus accordingly.

Move the player sprite towards an exit point to switch to a different map.

The player cannot run past walls nor can the player move further from the edge of the window.
