# The Grinnell College Experience

### Idea and Goals
We want to create a video game that uses 32x32 pixels textures to recreate Grinnell College in a virtualized setting. We wish to utilize this in a fashion to be able to run this game on mobile devices, including iOS and Android. We ended up swapping to the Godot Engine for this game, for convenience in compiling to iOS.

### Layout
As of right now, our repository layout consists mostly of the Godot Engine files and the `assets`, `scripts`, and `scenes` folder. We will likely add many things and the scrips will either be in GDScript or C#, most likely. We may potentially also add C++, but that is unlikely. However, if we switch to an established game engine, then this will change completely to match the git requirements of project code for the respective game engine.

We have our backlog at the following link: https://github.com/orgs/The-Grinnell-College-Experience-Team/projects
Thanks to Github Issues, here we will be able to communicate and track any issues that may arise.

We currently plan on utilizing 43x20 grid system displayed on the phone, consisting of 32x32 textures.
